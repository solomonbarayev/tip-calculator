## My process

- First step was to build the component with html
- style everything with scss preprocessing
- Make page responsive
- Added calculator functionality with vanilla JS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The two most important things I got out of this exercise were

1. Learning SCSS. I used this project to teach myself scss from scratch.
   Learned how to implement nesting, variables, mixins, extends, forwards, etc.
2. Vanilla JS practice. Exercised the skill to work with DOM elements and calculations.

### Continued development

I plan on learning React library and implementing React into this and future projects down the line.
